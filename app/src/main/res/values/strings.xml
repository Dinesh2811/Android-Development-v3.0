        We then set an OnOffsetChangedListener on the CollapsingToolbarLayout to be notified when the toolbar offset changes. The maxOffset variable is calculated as the height of the toolbar minus the visible scrim height trigger. This value is used to calculate a ratio based on the current offset, which is then used to adjust the alpha and scale of the title and subtitle text to create a fading effect.
